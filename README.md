# CG-Miniproject-Analog-clock

Aim:

 In this program we have designed an analogue clock which tells the current time on the 
language.
A clock is a device used to measure, keep, and systems clock using graphics in c programming language.


 


Introduction:

In this program we have designed an analogue clock which tells the current time on the systems clock using graphics in c programming indicate time. The clock is one of the oldest human inventions, meeting the need to measure intervals of time shorter than the natural units: the day, the lunar month, and the year. Devices operating on several physical processes have been used over the millennia.
We start the code by include the header files “stdio.h”  “dos.h” “stdlib.h” “math.h” “time.h” and “graphics.h” .
The methods used in making of this program is given in the problem definition.
